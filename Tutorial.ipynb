    "PC: Open up the command prompt or cmd.\n",
    "MAC/OSX: Open up terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then proceed by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see something saying:\n",
    "Python 3.5.2\n",
    "or \n",
    "Python 2.7.14\n",
    "\n",
    "That means it is already installed and you are actually running the interactive prompt.\n",

    "## Installing Python\n",
    "To install python head over to the [python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "Once here you can select the python3 version or the python2 version. This tutorial will work \n",
    "with both of the versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you select and download the version, run the installer. For the python3 version,\n",
    "be sure to select the box \"Add Python 3.6(or other version #) to PATH\". Doing so will ensure\n",
    "that code you write in other text editors will work.\n",

    "Once the installer is finished, open up your command prompt(PC) or terminal(MAC) and type:\n",

    "    python\n",
