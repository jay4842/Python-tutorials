### About Python
Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National
Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. It is a high-level 
programming language. Meaning that the words and syntax that make up the language is very close 
to english. It is also an interactive language due to the prompt that comes with it. And finally 
Python is Object-Oriented(will be explained), which is a programming technique using the idea of
encapsulating code within objects.
